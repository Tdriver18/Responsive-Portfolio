<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="assets/images/download.png" class="auth-image" alt="Tyler Driver">
<p>I have attended college at Red Rocks Community College, Metropolitan State University, and the University of Colorado Denver to further my knowledge in Multidisciplinary Drafting and Engineering Design and Full stack web development. Some of the drafting and design softwareâ€™s I know include AutoCAD, Cadworx, Plant 3D, Plant P&ID, Revit, Manage, Simulate, and Navisworks. While I do know many different aspects of design work, my primary work experience has been in Oil & Gas upstream and midstream production sites as well as manufacturing plants over 500,000 square feet. In my experience, I have designed large facilities with little to no supervision and traveled to sites for startup both domestic and international. I am a very detail oriented worker with a focus on speed and accuracy working on electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC, or structural disciplines. I have used my programming skills and knowledge in software development to create automated drafting and design practices and help with companywide organization and process streamline.</p>
